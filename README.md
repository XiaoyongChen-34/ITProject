# COMP30022_Team005_Gamergunk Parson's Problem Project

## Project overview and objectives.
This project aims to design an online platform for students to complete parson's problems based on different topics and contexts.
In particular, this project is designed for students learning Elements of Data Processing, and the topics are related to data analytics.
The students are able to challenge themselves with AI (Gemini) generated problems, reorder the shuffled code to test their understandings
of various topics. The context of a question is purely designed to make the problem more engaging and more applicable to the real world.

### Current implemented features:

* Drag and Drop
* Question Regeneration
* Check output of assembled code
* Topic & Context Dropdown
* Flag a problem
* Submit question
* View Problem Description
* Admin login
* Performance check
* Filtering data based on context, topic, time spent and correctness
* A simple roadmap page

### Features coming up:
